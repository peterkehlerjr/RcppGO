It can be used to solve unconstrained classic or stochastic optimization problems. \r\n\r\n### What are the key features?\r\nRcppGO \r\n* is fast due to its implementation in C++\r\n* is easy to use\r\n* requires little knowledge about programming\r\n* is robust\r\n\r\n### Disadvantages\r\nDue to its concept as an stochastic optimization algorithm, the results are also stochastic. Classic optimization problems will converge faster using classic optimization algorithms. \r\n\r\n### How do I try it out?\r\nDownload the files in the repository and compile them. An installation instruction is included. So far only Linux and OS X are supported.\r\n\r\n### Current status\r\nAs of Oct 2012 the project is at version 0.1. Updates will follow irregularly.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nPeter Kehler"}
