A function is difficult from a mathematical perspective in this context if it is not continuous, not differentiable, or if it has multiple maxima and minima.** _(Weise, T., (2009). Global Optimization Algorithms – Theory and Application. P.56)_ \r\n\r\nThe **RcppGO** algorithm is loosely based on _Kaveh, A. and Talatahari, (2010). A Novel Heuristic Optimization Method: Charged System Search. Acta Mechanica, 213(3-4):267–289._\r\n\r\n### What are the key features?\r\n**RcppGO** \r\n* applicable to difficult objective functions,\r\n* is fast due to the implementation in **C++**,\r\n* is easy to use within **R**,\r\n* is open-source under LGPL 3.\r\n\r\n### Advantages\r\n**RcppGO** can be used to solve objective functions meeting the following criteria. The objective function\r\n* is non-continuous, \r\n* has prohibited zones,\r\n* has side-limits,\r\n* is non-smooth,\r\n* is non-convex.  \r\n* The algorithm doesn't require you to provide a good starting point. \r\n\r\n### Disadvantages\r\nDue to its stochastic approach, the results of the algorithm are also stochastic. Continuous optimization problems will converge faster and most likely produce results with higher accuracy using gradient-based methods. \r\n\r\n### How do I try it \r\nDownload the **RcppGO** package from this site and follow the included installation instructions.\r\n\r\n### Supported OS\r\n* Linux\r\n* OS X\r\n* Windows (not tested)\r\n\r\n### Current status\r\nAs of Oct 2012 the project is at version 0.1. \r\n\r\n### Author\r\nPeter Kehler Jr"}
