# Introduction
_RcppGO_ is a package designed for optimization problems. The code was originally written in _Cpp_. With the use of the _Rcpp_ package by [@Eddelbuettel:2011c] it is now translated into _R_. Newton's laws of gravity and motion are the basis of the algorithm as described in [@Kaveh:2010b]. _RcppGO_ is an allusion to the integration of _Rcpp_, the concept of _Gravity_ at the core of the algorithm and _Optimization_ as the purpose of the package.


# Installation
**RcppGO** is hosted at [https://github.com/peterkehlerjr/RcppGO](https://github.com/peterkehlerjr/RcppGO). The installation via _github_ requires the package _devtools_ [@Wickham:2014]. 
Assuming _devtools_ is not present in your library, the installation is done via:
```{r install, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github('peterkehlerjr/RcppGO')
```

# Examples
After installing the required packages, they have to be loaded into _R_. 

```{r loading, echo=FALSE}
library(RcppGO)
```
Now we can start to play around with the package. Before going into detail, I will present two examples how to use its functionality.

## Example 1
Let's have a look at our first example. Say, we have a cost function defined by the following objective function:
$$f(x) = (x-2)^2 + 3, x \in  \mathbf{N}_{+} ,  x  \geqq 1 $$
We assume the constraints that $x$ is greater equal 1 and discrete positive. The objective is to find the minimum costs given a quantity of our product. 


Defining the objective function in _R_ is straight forward. We will call it _Fun01_.
```{r example01}
Fun01 <- function(X)
  {
   (X-3)^2 + 4
  }
```

Let's look at a plot of _Fun01_:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(Fun01, xlim=c(1,6), ylim = c(0,15),ylab = "cost function")
points(x = 3, y = 4, lwd=2, col="red")
```


Now let us 
```{r}
Example01 <- RcppGO(ObjectiveFunction = Fun01, 
                    Args = 1, 
                    Lower = -10, 
                    Upper = 10
                    )
```



```{r}
str(Example01)
```



```{r}
Example01$GMemory
```


```{r}
plot(x=Example01, xlim = c(-10,10), bestsolution = TRUE)
```


## Example 2
 to bit more complicated objective function.
$$f(x,y)=\frac{1}{4} x^4 - \frac{1}{2} x^2 + \frac{1}{10}x + \frac{1}{2}y^2$$

![AluffiPentiny](/Users/peterkehler/Dropbox/technology/github/RcppGO/vignettes/figure/AluffiPentiny01.png)
Let's look for the minimum of the function. 


```{r,tidy=TRUE, }
# defining a benchmark function
# min at -0.352386, X in [-10,10]^2
AluffiPentiny <- function(X)
  {
    1/4*X[,1]^4 - 1/2*X[,1]^2 + 1/10*X[,1] + 1/2*X[,2]^2
  }
```


```{r}

# call and save the optimization process in 'demo01''
demo01 <- RcppGO(ObjectiveFunction=AluffiPentiny,
                 Args=2,
                 Lower = -10,
                 Upper = 10,
                 User=FALSE,
                 Scale=0.1)

# show the best solutions found
demo01$GMemory
```


```{r}
plot(x=demo01, plot.type = "wireframe", bestsolution = TRUE)
```
