# Introduction
_RcppGO_ is a package designed for optimization problems. The code was originally written in _Cpp_. With the use of the _Rcpp_ package by [@Eddelbuettel:2011c] it is now translated into _R_. Newton's laws of gravity and motion are the basis of the algorithm as described in [@Kaveh:2010b]. _RcppGO_ is an allusion to the integration of _Rcpp_, the concept of _Gravity_ at the core of the algorithm and _Optimization_ as the purpose of the package.


# Installation
**RcppGO** is hosted at [https://github.com/peterkehlerjr/RcppGO](https://github.com/peterkehlerjr/RcppGO). The installation via _github_ requires the package _devtools_ [@Wickham:2014]. 
Assuming _devtools_ is not present in your library, the installation is done via:
```{r install, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github('peterkehlerjr/RcppGO')
```

# Examples
After installing the required packages, they have to be loaded into _R_. 

```{r loading, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(RcppGO)
```
Now we can start to play around. 

## Example 1
Let's have a look at our first example, defined by the following objective function:
$$f(x) = -x^2$$


```{r example01, cache=TRUE}
Fun01 <- function(X)
  {
  -X^2
  }

Example01 <- RcppGO(ObjectiveFunction = Fun01, Args = 1, Lower = -10, Upper = 10, n = 20, g = 20, Maximize = TRUE)

str(Example01)

Example01$GMemory

plot(x=Example01, xlim = c(-10,10), bestsolution = TRUE)
```

## Example 2
 to bit more complicated objective function.
$$f(x,y)=\frac{1}{4} x^4 - \frac{1}{2} x^2 + \frac{1}{10}x + \frac{1}{2}y^2$$

![AluffiPentiny](/Users/peterkehler/Dropbox/technology/github/RcppGO/vignettes/figure/AluffiPentiny01.png)
Let's look for the minimum of the function. 

```{r AluffyPlot, echo=FALSE}
# nothing
```




```{r, cache=TRUE}
# defining a benchmark function
# min at -0.352386, X in [-10,10]^2
AluffiPentiny <- function(X)
  {
    1/4*X[,1]^4 - 1/2*X[,1]^2 + 1/10*X[,1] + 1/2*X[,2]^2
  }

# call and save the optimization process in 'demo01''
demo01 <- RcppGO(ObjectiveFunction=AluffiPentiny,
                 Args=2,
                 Lower = -10,
                 Upper = 10,
                 User=FALSE,
                 Scale=0.1)

# show the best solutions found
demo01$GMemory
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(x=demo01, plot.type = "wireframe", bestsolution = TRUE)
```



# The two main functions

# The RcppGO function

sessionInfo()
